# most-tested

Automated testing is a mystery to some, an essential fortress to others, and
many of the rest of us are somewhere in-between. Sure, you've probably heard of
unit tests and API tests.

In this session, we'll explore every conceivable means to test ... a simple log
in page. Using approaches like ... accessibility testing, visual regression
testing, acceptance testing, gherkin tests, load testing, and more. Beyond the
tools and technologies of automated testing, we'll also look at some techniques
and measurements that can be applied to each of the tools.
